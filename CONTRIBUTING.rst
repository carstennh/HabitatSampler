Needs
----------------

* the routine is quit slow, particularly using > 100.000.000. image pixels or > 50 image layers 
* the code does not use all possible computer ressources; **pro:** the routine can be executed on a standard PC **con:** not yet optimized for processing speed 
* **library of spectral-temporal profiles** plus an open interface for permanent extension is to be intergared  

* is the **user manual** clear enough?
* is the **input/output** clear?
* what **additional features** are useful?

How
----------------

* copy folders to you local system and re-code, translate or compile using literature reference 
* ask me for imporvements and R implementations <carsten.neumann@gfz-potsdam.de>
* report bugs on gitlab or send me an email

  
Results
